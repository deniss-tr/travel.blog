## Travel blog

This is my final training project. Dynamic website based on Laravel framework. My purpose was to make full site and at the same time improve my skills in frontand and backand. I used .psd template of main page [link](https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/black-white-free-psd-template/) and made layout on it. The rest of the pages were invented by myself.


Project under development.
